Nobuco filters LinkedIn posts based on writing style, not content.

Two toggleable filters (click the extension icon):

Spam-style posts
- Excessive line breaks (one sentence per line)
- Artificially short paragraphs
- Heavy emoji usage in layout
- Engagement bait openers

Polls
- Hides all posts containing LinkedIn polls

How it works:
- Analyzes post text locally in your browser
- Scores posts using format heuristics (line breaks, length, emoji density)
- Hides posts that match your enabled filters
- All processing happens on your device, nothing is sent anywhere

Privacy guarantee:
- Zero data collection
- Zero network requests
- Zero tracking or analytics
- Open source code you can audit
- Conservative filtering: when uncertain, posts remain visible

This is format filtering, not content moderation.

The extension doesn't care what topics you discuss, only whether the formatting is designed to manipulate engagement through artificial line breaks and layout tricks.
